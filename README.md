# Australian Accident Analysis Dashboard (1989-2021)

## About
The Australian Road Deaths Database is a comprehensive collection of road transport crash fatalities in Australia reported by the police to the State and Territory road safety authorities. This dataset spans over three decades, from 1989 to 2021, encompassing a wide range of parameters related to road accidents in Australia.

## Dataset Details
The dataset provides a plethora of information about each crash incident, including:

**Crash ID**: Unique identifier for each crash incident.<br>
**State**: The Australian state where the crash occurred, providing regional context.<br>
**Month, Year**: Time details of the crash occurrence, enabling temporal analysis.<br>
**Day of the Week**: The specific day of the week when the crash happened, facilitating weekday-based analysis.<br>
**Time**: Time of day when the crash occurred, aiding in analyzing accident trends based on different times.<br>
**Crash Type**: Categorization of the type of crash (e.g., head-on collision, rear-end collision, etc.).<br>
**Bus Involvement**: Indicates involvement of a bus in the crash.<br>
**Heavy Rigid Truck Involvement**: Indicates involvement of heavy rigid trucks in the crash.<br>
**Articulated Truck Involvement**: Involvement of articulated trucks in the crash.<br>
**Speed Limit**: Speed limit on the road where the crash occurred, offering insights into accidents concerning speed restrictions.<br>
**Road User**: Type of road user involved in the crash (e.g., driver, pedestrian, cyclist, etc.).<br>
**Gender**: Gender of the individual involved in the crash.<br>
**Age**: Age of the individual involved in the crash, facilitating age-based analysis.<br>
**Christmas Period**: Indicator for the Christmas period, potentially highlighting increased accident rates during festive seasons.<br>
**Easter Period**: Indicator for the Easter period, another period that might affect accident rates.<br>
**Age Group**: Categorization of individuals into specific age groups, allowing for age-specific analysis.<br>
**Day of the Week**: The day of the week (repeated field), providing redundant but necessary data for cross-verification.<br>
**Time of Day**: Time of day (repeated field), similarly aiding in data validation.<br>
## Potential Use Cases
**Trend Analysis and Forecasting**<br>
**Policy Development and Decision Making**<br>
**Targeted Safety Campaigns**<br>
**Infrastructure Planning and Improvement**<br>
## Tableau Dashboard
I've created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize and analyze this dataset. You can access the dashboard here.

## Source
The dataset has been sourced from the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE). BITRE is a key entity providing economic analysis, research, and statistics on infrastructure, transport, and cities. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for both policy development by the Australian government and for fostering a broader understanding within the community about road safety issues.

## Note
The dataset includes both historical and recent data. However, it's important to note that recent months' data might be preliminary and subject to revision.
Caution should be exercised while interpreting and analyzing the data, considering the potential for revisions and the complexity of factors contributing to road accidents.
## Acknowledgements
I extend my gratitude to the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics for compiling and providing this dataset. This dataset plays a crucial role in enabling in-depth analysis and insights into road safety trends and patterns in Australia.
